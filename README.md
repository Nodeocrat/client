The build system boilerplate was created using the create-react-app command line utility.
It has been 'ejected' and customised a lot since. The only other code in this project which is not entirely my own is
ScriptLoader module in src/services/ScriptLoader and PropsRoute in src/lib/CustomRoutes (see comments in files to find the author).
