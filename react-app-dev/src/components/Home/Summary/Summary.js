    <p>With experience in big-data real-time analytics, banking software and a number of personal projects, I have solid experience of working with different types of software in different programming languages across the full stack and software life cycle. I have worked with both badly and well designed software so have a thorough appreciation of the importance of good software design and the trade-offs between complexity, time constraints and maintenance. I am also up to date with the latest web technologies which have transformed web development for the better.</p>
